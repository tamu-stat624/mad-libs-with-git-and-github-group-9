Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Avirup,

I am writing to you from a great spaceship in a beautiful galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a blue rocket in September. There are 23 [7] and [8] of stick here! In the
[10] there is a pool full of bromine. I fall asleep each night on an effusive bed of
[13] and dream of [14] calamitously. It feels as though I have lived here for
7 seconds. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
trekking on a diligent 62 year-old Cessna 172 Skyhawk!!

Best wishes,
Ramana
